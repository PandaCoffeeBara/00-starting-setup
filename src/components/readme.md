## Introduction

This document provides a guide to purpose of the components folder

## Components Folder

The `components` folder contains reusable components that are used to build the user interface of the web app. Components are the building blocks of a React application and can be reused across different parts of the app. Components can be simple, such as buttons or input fields, or complex, such as forms or modals. The components folder is organized into subfolders based on the type of components, such as `atoms`, `molecules`, `organisms`, and `templates`. This helps in organizing the components based on their complexity and reusability.
