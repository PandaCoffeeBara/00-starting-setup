## Introduction

This document provides a guide to purpose of the assets folder

## Assets Folder

The `assets` folder contains static assets such as images, fonts, and stylesheets that are used in the web app. Static assets are files that are not processed by Webpack and are directly copied to the build folder during the build process. The assets folder is used to store files that are referenced in the code, such as images for components or stylesheets for the web app.

The assets folder is organized into subfolders based on the type of assets, such as `images`, `fonts`, and `styles`. This helps in organizing the assets based on their purpose and makes it easier to reference them in the code.
