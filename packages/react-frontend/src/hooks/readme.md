## Introduction

This document provides a guide to purpose of the hooks folder

## Hooks Folder

The `hooks` folder contains custom hooks that are used to share logic between components. Custom hooks are reusable functions that can be used to manage state, side effects, and other logic in functional components. Custom hooks are a powerful feature of React that allow developers to extract and reuse logic across multiple components.

The hooks folder is meant for non feature specific hooks that can be shared across different features of the web app. Hooks that are specific to a feature should be placed inside the feature folder.
